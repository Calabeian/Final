 <dt>Before</dt>
  <dd>When coming up with ideas for tattoos I believe that the most important
  part is that it matters to you. As long as the idea has meaning to you, odds are, 
  you won't regret it.<br>
  Once you have your idea you need to find a shop. You want to find a tattoo artist
  who is good at the style you want and whether or not they take walk-ins or appointments
  only. After that you're set to get your tattoo!</dd>
 <dt>During</dt>
  <dd>I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, if you have never gotten a tattoo it is gonna hurt.
  You don't want to squirm alot in the chair because that makes the artist's job way
  harder.<br> 
  They want you to be satisfied with your tattoo, but they really don't like it when
  you micro-manage. If you are courteous and listen to your artist everything will
  go smoothly and you will end up with a nice tattoo.</dd>
 <dt>After</dt>
  <dd>Once the artist has finished your tattoo don't forget to tip!<br>
  To keep your tattoo clean and healthy you are going to want to wash it everyday, for
  at least a week, with anti-bacterial soap and then lotion it with unscented lotion.</dd>
