<p>My mom used to read this book to me every night before bed. Her birthday is on November 13th and I
want to get a tattoo with the title of this book incorporated into it as a dedication to my mom and 
everything she did for me. I haven't always gotten along with my mom, but as I grew up I realized everything
she did was out of love even if I didn't agree with it. I want her to know that no matter what I still, and
always will, love her.</p>
