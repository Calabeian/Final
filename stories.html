<p>When I was a boy I lived with my mom in Colorado. She was a very religious mother who only wanted me to be
safe. The only problem was, to do that, she had to take it to the extent that she kept me in a bubble my entire
childhood. I wasn't allowed to do anything growing up. Honestly it would be easier to list the things I was
allowed to do. I could read, watch 30 mins of approved tv, play 30 mins of approved games, or play outside by
myself. As a kid I was incredibly lonely and everyday I could feel this darkness slowly overcome me until
I finally lost the will to live. I had resorted to harming myself and just wanting everything to end. That
was until I saw a documentary on kingdoms of old. I saw how kings were controlled by no one and free to do as
they please. That was the time I saw some light in the darkness. I wanted to be a king. Not in the sense that
I rule over people or that I am somehow superior to others, but to just have the ability to do what I want
when I want. I just wanted to be free. That is what got me through my childhood. Everytime I wanted everything
to end, when the darkness would come close to enveloping me, I would think about how close I am to becoming a
"king". Now I have that word tattooed on my forearm to remind myself no matter how bad life gets or how much 
I want to end it, I made it through once and I can do it again.</p>
